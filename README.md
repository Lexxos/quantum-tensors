# Quantum tensors

For "Quantum Game 2" we needed a fast and precise way to simulate quantum stuff so after tinkering with mathjs and tensorflow we decided to code what we need from scratch.

## Requirements

- Sparse matrices: There is a looot of zeros.
- Complex numbers: Because we are in complex vector space.
- Named dimensions: To avoid mixing carrots and weasels.
- Tensor operations

## Interesting ideas

* Better notation (e.g. `â¨‚(op1, opt2, op3)`)
* Partial application
